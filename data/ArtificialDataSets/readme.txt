These are some artificial data sets containing one concept drift.
They were created using an earlier version the drifts generator available at 

http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~minkull/opensource/

So, the parameter files will not load correctly using the current version.

Files with Sev1, 2, 3 represent data with low, medium and high severity.
Files with Sp1, 2, 3 represent data with drifting time 1, 0.25N and 0.5N.

We ask any papers using these data sets to cite

The following paper has also used these data sets, and you may wish to consider it:
